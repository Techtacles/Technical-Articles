# Technical-Articles
Over the years, I have written technical articles on software engineering, data engineering, cloud computing and machine learning. I have also written technical articles for big names like Airbyte, Paperspace, Redpanda, Draft Dev and so many others. <br>
You can read about some of my content here:
<br>
## Airbyte
1.) Replicate postgres data to Redshift for analytics : https://airbyte.com/tutorials/postgres-to-redshift-data-replication<br>
2.) Optimize Redshift performance and reduce costs: https://airbyte.com/blog/optimize-redshift-performance-and-reduce-costs<br><br>
<br>
## Estuary Flow
1.) Stream data from Postgres to Snowflake: https://www.estuary.dev/stream-data-postgres-to-snowflake/<br>
2.) Two ways to connect Google Sheets with Snowflake: https://www.estuary.dev/google-sheets-to-snowflake/<br>
## Redpanda
3.) Building an engine of record with Apache Spark (scala) , Bigquery and Redpanda : https://redpanda.com/blog/engine-of-record-apache-spark-bigquery<br>
